OpenTeacher mobile on github
============================

This branch is only here because PhoneGap build
(http://build.phonegap.com) needs a github branch to pull from. The
actual code inside this branch is automatically generated by a script
in OpenTeacher's main branch, which is on Launchpad. This also means
that **all changes made to this branch are essentially worthless**.
If you want to help, please give the launchpad branch a look instead. Thanks.

Code generation instructions
----------------------------

In a terminal:

- ``bzr branch lp:openteacher``
- ``python openteacher.py -p generate-mobile <output_dir> <minify>``

Specify the directory to place the source in as the first argument and
specify 'true' or 'false' (without quotes) as the second, depending on
wheter or not you want to minify the javascript and css code.
